   2. Concepts:

      - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

      - File Handling

      - Conditional Statements & Loops

      - String Handling

   3. Libraries Used:

      - &ltiostream&gt

      - &ltfstream&gt

      - <string.h>

      - <conio.h>

      - <time.h>

      - <stdlib.h>

**📁 File Structure (Auto-Generated)**
| File Name    | Purpose                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `store.txt`  | Stores all book records          |
| `cart.txt`   | Stores cart items                |
| `bill.txt`   | Stores bill details              |
| `profit.txt` | Stores total profit              |
| `dukaan.txt` | Temporary file for delete/update |
| `temp.txt`   | Temporary cart file              |



**🔐 Login Credentials (Default)**
   1. Customer

      - User ID: 6284

      - Password: SSSS

   2. Manager

      - User ID: 9988

      - Password: SSSS


**▶️ How to Run the Program**
   1. Open a C++ compiler (Turbo C++, Dev C++, Code::Blocks, or VS Code with MinGW)

   2. Create a new .cpp file

   3. Paste the source code

   4. Compile and run the program


**⚠️ Note**
This program uses <conio.h>, which works best on Windows-based compilers like:

   - Turbo C++

   - Dev C++

   - Code::Blocks (Windows)


**🧠 Concepts Demonstrated**
   1. Class & Object usage

   2. File I/O operations (ifstream, ofstream)

   3. Menu-driven programming

   4. Basic authentication system

   5. Persistent storage using text files
